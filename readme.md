## 1. Introduction

Trolling Trolls (TT) is - at the current state- a proof of concept aiming at a platform that supports moderators to detect hate speech and offensive content on online platforms.
TT is a project that started in TechLabs' Digital Shaper project. To learn particular digital skills, four people completed the DataScience track, one the WebDevelopment (backend) track, and one the UserExperience track. Thus, the project served the purpose to learn and explore within these fields.

After the conclusion of the TechLabs semester, we decided to continue the work on TT.
